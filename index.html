     <h2>History</h2>
     <p>
        Shoes were just shoes for the first 80-some-odd years of the
         20th century. Then in the mid-1980s, Nike released a pair of 
         basketball shoes featuring a certain ex-Tarheel. The Air Jordan
          was born, and the rest, as they say, is history.
     </p>


     <p>As legend has it, the iconic Air Jordan sneaker series almost never
      lifted off. Soon after Michael Jordan debuted the Air Jordan I, the
       NBA stepped in and banned the shoe because they featured "non-regulation"
        colors. Suffice it to say, Jordan didn't listen and thusly, the great
         basketball shoe boom began.</p>
